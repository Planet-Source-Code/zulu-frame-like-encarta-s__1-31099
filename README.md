### Description

I was impressed with the encarta UI, and i love the way they show the content in a frames that change the color when the mouse is over.....well tell me simple but i liked so i decided to make it, this is my second control and hope you like it, i wanna hear your comments ppl. The next version will include support for menus (soon), if you have encarta, you know what i mean, if not...wait a few until i finish it!!!!
